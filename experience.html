            <br/>

            <p>I worked as an intern at Pharr Connect, where I developed skills in customer service, problem-solving,
                 and teamwork. During my internship, I assisted customers any questions they had and resolved issues 
                 in their digital literacy classes. This experience helped me improve my communication skills and 
                 taught me how to adapt in a fast-paced environment.</p>
            
            <br/>

            <p> I am currently taking beginner courses in computer science, which have introduced me to programming
            concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving skills at the abstract level. I am also taking a wellness course,
             where I am learning about the importance of physical wellness and nutrition.</p>
