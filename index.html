        <br/>

            <p class="abtMeText"> My name is <b>Briana Almaguer</b>. I am a Multidisciplinary Studies major at the
                <i>University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley</i>, where I am also minoring in:</p>

            <ol type="i" class="list-aboutme"> <!--ordered list tag-->
                <li>Computer Science</li>
                <li>Business Administration</li>
                <li>Kinesiology</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="abtMeText"> I chose this path because I enjoy learning across different fields and bringing ideas
                from multiple perspectives. Each of these areas challenges me in ways that gives me the tools I need to
            think strategically and creatively about problems</p>
            

            <br/>

            <p class="abtMeText"> I am currently learning <b>C++</b> and <b>Python</b>. These programming languages give me the 
            opportunity to strengthen and grow my problem-solving skills and expand my knowledge about technology. I enjoy the process
            of learning new concepts hope to apply them into future projects.</p>
        
            <br/>

            <p class="abtMeText"> My academic goal is to graduate with a <i>B3 Literacy Seal</i>. I would like to graduate with
                this seal because it would represent my love for my culture, communication with others, and growth as a student.
                In the future, I want to pursure multiple career paths in either of my minors. One thing I would like to go though,
                is to create an app that is accessible for diverse groups of people, including those with disabilities.</p>
            
            <br/>

                as well as a way to contact me.</p>
